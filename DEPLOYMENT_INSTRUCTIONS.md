# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions for jamesdesign.me

## Overview
This repository has been configured to deploy the Next.js portfolio to GitHub Pages with the custom domain `jamesdesign.me`. The deployment is fully automated via GitHub Actions.

## What Has Been Configured

### 1. Next.js Static Export
- Updated `next.config.js` with `output: 'export'` to generate static HTML files
- Configured `images.unoptimized: true` for static image handling
- Added `public/CNAME` file with the domain `jamesdesign.me`
- Added `public/.nojekyll` to prevent Jekyll processing

### 2. GitHub Actions Workflow
- Created `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for automated deployment
- Workflow triggers on push to `main` branch
- Builds the Next.js app and deploys to GitHub Pages

### 3. Build Output
- Static files are generated in the `out` directory
- The `out` directory is excluded from git (in `.gitignore`)
- GitHub Actions will build and deploy automatically

## GitHub Repository Settings Required

After merging this PR to the `main` branch, you need to configure GitHub Pages in the repository settings:

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages with GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository on GitHub: `https://github.com/jamesthegreati/jamesthegreati.github.io`
2. Click on **Settings** (top menu)
3. Scroll down and click on **Pages** (left sidebar under "Code and automation")
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
5. Save the changes

### Step 2: Configure Custom Domain (if not already done)

1. In the same **Pages** settings section
2. Under **Custom domain**, enter: `jamesdesign.me`
3. Click **Save**
4. GitHub will automatically create/update the CNAME file (our workflow already includes it)
5. Wait for DNS check to complete (may take a few minutes)

### Step 3: Configure DNS at Your Domain Registrar

You need to configure DNS records at your domain registrar (where you bought jamesdesign.me):

**Option A: Using A Records (Recommended)**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: jamesthegreati.github.io
```

**Option B: Using CNAME (Alternative)**
```
Type: CNAME
Name: @
Value: jamesthegreati.github.io

Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: jamesthegreati.github.io
```

### Step 4: Enable HTTPS (Recommended)

1. After DNS is configured and propagated (may take 24-48 hours)
2. Go back to **Settings** > **Pages**
3. Check the box for **Enforce HTTPS**
4. GitHub will automatically provision an SSL certificate

## Testing the Deployment

### Local Testing
You can test the static build locally:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
cd out
python3 -m http.server 8080
# Visit http://localhost:8080
```

### After Deployment
1. After merging to `main`, the GitHub Action will run automatically
2. Check the **Actions** tab to monitor the deployment progress
3. Once complete, visit `https://jamesdesign.me` to see your site
4. It may take a few minutes for DNS changes to propagate globally

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Site shows README instead of website
**Solution**: Ensure GitHub Pages source is set to "GitHub Actions" (not "Deploy from a branch")

### Issue: 404 errors on navigation
**Solution**: The static export includes all pages as HTML files. The workflow handles this correctly.

### Issue: Custom domain not working
**Solution**: 
- Verify DNS records at your domain registrar
- Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
- Use `dig jamesdesign.me` or `nslookup jamesdesign.me` to check DNS
- Ensure the CNAME file contains only `jamesdesign.me` (no http://, no trailing slash)

### Issue: Deployment fails
**Solution**: 
- Check the Actions tab for error details
- Ensure repository has Pages enabled
- Verify workflow permissions (Settings > Actions > General > Workflow permissions)

## Important Notes

1. **Never commit the `out` directory** - It's generated by the build process
2. **The CNAME file** in `public/` will be copied to the `out` directory during build
3. **Deployment is automatic** - Just push to `main` branch
4. **First deployment** may take a few minutes longer
5. **DNS propagation** can take 24-48 hours globally

## Manual Deployment (if needed)

If you need to manually trigger a deployment:
1. Go to the **Actions** tab
2. Select the "Deploy Next.js to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**
4. Select the `main` branch
5. Click **Run workflow**
