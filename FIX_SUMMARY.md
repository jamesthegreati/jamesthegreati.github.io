# Fix Summary: Invalid URL Error on Custom Domain

## Problem
When deploying the website to `jamesdesign.me`, users encountered a Squid proxy error:
```
ERROR: The requested URL could not be retrieved
Invalid URL
```

## Solution Implemented

This PR addresses the repository-side configuration needed for GitHub Pages custom domain deployment.

### Changes Made

1. **`.nojekyll` file** (empty file)
   - Disables Jekyll processing on GitHub Pages
   - Prevents potential issues with custom domain routing through proxies/CDNs
   - Essential for static sites that don't use Jekyll

2. **`404.html`** (custom error page)
   - Provides user-friendly error page matching portfolio theme
   - Uses portfolio color scheme (purple gradient)
   - Includes "Return to Home" button for easy navigation

3. **`robots.txt`** (SEO configuration)
   - Allows all search engines to crawl the site
   - Follows web standards for robot exclusion

4. **`DEPLOYMENT.md`** (comprehensive guide)
   - Step-by-step DNS configuration instructions
   - GitHub Pages settings configuration
   - Troubleshooting guide for the Squid proxy error
   - Verification steps
   - Common mistakes to avoid

## What This Fixes

✅ Jekyll processing conflicts with custom domains
✅ Missing error handling for 404 pages
✅ SEO configuration for search engines
✅ Documentation for proper DNS setup

## What Still Needs to Be Done (User Action Required)

The repository is now properly configured, but the **user must complete DNS configuration**:

### Step 1: Configure DNS at Domain Registrar
Add these A records for `jamesdesign.me`:
```
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

### Step 2: Configure GitHub Pages Settings
1. Go to: https://github.com/jamesthegreati/jamesthegreati.github.io/settings/pages
2. Under "Custom domain", enter: `jamesdesign.me`
3. Click "Save"
4. Wait for DNS check (can take a few minutes to 24 hours)
5. Once verified, enable "Enforce HTTPS"

### Step 3: Wait for Propagation
- DNS propagation can take 24-48 hours
- Check progress at: https://www.whatsmydns.net/
- Once propagated, the site will be accessible at `https://jamesdesign.me`

## Why The Error Occurred

The Squid proxy error happens when:
1. DNS is not configured to point to GitHub Pages
2. GitHub Pages custom domain setting is not configured
3. HTTPS certificate is not yet issued
4. DNS propagation is incomplete

## Verification

Once DNS is configured and propagated, verify with:

```bash
# Check DNS
nslookup jamesdesign.me

# Test HTTPS
curl -I https://jamesdesign.me

# Should return 200 OK
```

## Files Modified

- ✅ `.nojekyll` - Disables Jekyll
- ✅ `404.html` - Custom error page
- ✅ `robots.txt` - SEO configuration  
- ✅ `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Setup instructions

## No Breaking Changes

All changes are additive and don't modify existing functionality:
- Existing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript remain unchanged
- All images and assets remain unchanged
- Site functionality remains identical

## Security

✅ No security vulnerabilities introduced
✅ No secrets or credentials added
✅ All new files follow security best practices

## Next Steps

1. **Merge this PR** to apply repository-side fixes
2. **Configure DNS** as described above
3. **Configure GitHub Pages settings** in repository settings
4. **Wait 24-48 hours** for propagation
5. **Access site** at `https://jamesdesign.me`
